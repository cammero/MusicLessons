# MusicLessons
Final Project
This program is designed to help music students find instructors. The student selects which type of instrument they are interested in learning, enters their zip code, and enters the distance they are willing to travel (in miles). The program returns the instructors and their rates within the desired radius. 

At this time, new student accounts are added to the database, but existing students are not able to log in. The functionality of adding courses to individual students is also not currrently functionable.

You will need to rebuild my database on your computer using the file in D2L. You also will have to change the username and password in the DatabaseManager class to your mySQL username and password.

Getting the ZipWise API to work is the coolest feature.
